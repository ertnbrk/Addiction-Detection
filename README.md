# Addiction-Detection
##### Classification of Addicts and Not Addicts Faces
This project leverages transfer learning to classify individuals as addict or not addict based on their facial images. I used the pre-trained InceptionV3 neural network model and develop it using the TensorFlow and Keras APIs.
